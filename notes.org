10-pin connector, 1.27mm pitch

The crystals on the m0 and feather say SDD17A or A406N on them, but are 32.7.. KHZ crystals

USB-C Multicomp http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1965372.pdf and amphenol https://www.amphenolcanada.com/ProductSearch/drawings/AC/12401548E4%232A.pdf
seem to have the same footprint... close (not quite).  For now try multicomp MC001003

Holes at 0.15, 0.15, 1.1,0.15...0.5, 1.15... 1.1,1.15e

- [ ] Check LEDs; they seem small

# Comparison with FemtoUSB

- We have connection between PA00/PA01 as x32in; should be our 32k oscillator.  They do as well, but they also use 4pF caps (not sure on their xtal) and have another xtal between PA14 and PA15, XIN/XOUT.  I have PA14 and PA15 disconnected.

- Their I2C pins (PA08, PA09, PA17) all go through 330Rs; mine disconnected

- My PA10/11 are TX/RX, just as pins out on theirs

e- USB seems connected similarly although PA28 connected to "id" pin via 330R and 100K to 3.3V, very odd.
- Pinout on p28
- Schematic checklist
 - Power Supply
   Close:
   - [ ] 0.1uf VDDANA (9) to GNDANA (10?) 
   - [ ] 0.1uf VDDIO (?) to GND 
   - [ ] 0.1uf VDDIN (30) GND
   - [ ] 1uf VDDCORE-GND
   Further: 
   - [ ] 10uf VDDANA/GNDANA
   - [ ] 10uf VDDIN GND
   Pwr (3.3v) to
   - [ ] VDDANA through inductor (?)
   - [ ] VDDIO
   - [ ] VDDIN

- Ext analog ref connections ignore
- Ext reset circuit ignore
- Clocks and oscillators
  - External Clock source xtal, rec load cap 15pf, I'm using 22pf
  - But "low frequency crystal oscillator optimized for use with 32khz watch crystal" between XIN32/XOut32.  This is the "external real time oscillator".

- [ ] Pull up resistor on SWCLK pin?  I do not do this currently (they say 1k) but it seems to not need it.

- USB interface
 - "recommend to increase ESD protection using dedicated transient suppressors"
 - recommended to connect shield and ground through RC filter to avoid USB cable becoming antenna
