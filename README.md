# Orb9k v3 Hardware
Kicad files for the `Orbotron 9000, version 3` (also known as `Orbotron 9001`).

All original design credits for the `Orbotron 9000` to Victor Putz.

This fork intends to further enhance the capabilities of the `Orbotron 9001` by integrating itself into the device as a replacement PCB 
that will replace the original `Spactec SpaceOrb 360` handheld 6-DOF controller PCB control board.

The secondary and original intent of this fork is to provide an output port the device so that it can be used as an RC controller via the 
trainer port on an FrSky Taranis RC Transmitter. This interface would provide a natural and innovative control interface for users 
operating FPV multirotor aircraft (replicating the controls used in the original 1995 game "Descent")
